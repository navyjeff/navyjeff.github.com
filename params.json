I study electrical engineering, so the bulk of my programming is modeling and data processing scripts. Most of what you see here won't be much more than snippets of code, but I have the occasional, more ambitious project. If you don't see my work here yet, you can always find it on my regular GitHub profile.\r\n","tagline":"by Jeff Borck"}
